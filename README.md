## Problem Statement

Mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly affecting young adults, yet many lack access to affordable, reliable, and easily accessible support. Traditional solutions like counseling centers or helplines are often underutilized due to stigma, limited awareness, or accessibility barriers. There is a need for a digital platform that empowers users to understand and manage their mental well-being, track their progress over time, access educational resources, and connect with peers or professionals for support. Additionally, the platform should provide tools for generating personalized reports to help users gain insights into their mental health trends.

## Objectives

- Raise awareness by providing accessible mental health education.
- Support well-being through self-help strategies and emergency contacts.
- Enable users to track mood and mental health consistently.
- Provide peer and professional support through online interaction.
- Generate personalized reports to help users analyze their progress.

---

## Features

The platform is designed around these core modules. Depending on the current codebase state, some modules may be “Planned” and can be implemented iteratively.

- Education (Awareness)
  - Curated articles
  - Condition overviews (stress, anxiety, depression), coping strategies
- Self‑Help (Immediate Support)
  - Guided breathing, grounding techniques, journaling prompts
  - Resource links and emergency contacts (hotlines, local services)
- Mood & Wellness Tracking
  - Daily mood check‑ins (e.g., 1–5 scale + tags + notes)
  - Optional screening questionnaires (e.g., PHQ‑9, GAD‑7) with clear disclaimers
- Community & Professional Support
  - Peer interaction (e.g., moderated chat/forum)
  - Professional directory or referral links
- Personalized Reports & Insights
  - Trend charts for mood over time
  - Streaks, triggers, tags, and summary insights
  - Export/print/share a personal wellness report

> Important: This project is not a substitute for professional medical advice or therapy. Include clear disclaimers and crisis resources.

## Architecture Overview

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Works as a static site; can run locally without a backend.
  - Interactivity for trackers, UI state, and simple persistence via LocalStorage.
- Backend (Planned/Optional):
  - If enabling accounts, sync, or community features: Node.js + a database with auth.
  - API design to store mood entries, journals, and assessments securely.
- Deployment: Vercel
  - Auto‑deploy on push to `main` when connected.

---

## Data and Privacy

- Local-only mode: Store data in the browser (LocalStorage/IndexedDB). User can clear data anytime.
- Cloud mode (if added): Require explicit consent, secure auth, encrypted transport (HTTPS), and clear data retention controls.
- Anonymization: Avoid storing personal identifiers unless necessary; provide data export and deletion options.
- Ethics: Add disclaimers, crisis links, and moderation for any community feature.

---

## Getting Started

You can view the live site at the link above. To run locally:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- Optional: Lightweight static server (VS Code Live Server, `serve`, or Python http.server)

### Local Run (quick start)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WalterMatsinhe/MentalHeathProject.git
cd MentalHeathProject
# Open index.html in your browser OR start a static server:
```

### Local Run (with a static server)

- VS Code + Live Server:
  - Open the folder in VS Code → Right‑click `index.html` → “Open with Live Server”
- Using npx:

  ```bash
  npx serve .
  ```

  Go to http://localhost:8080
